Save to Gallery: Allows users to save their edited memes directly to their device's gallery.
Flutter Riverpod: Utilized for state management, ensuring efficient handling of asynchronous data and UI updates.
Modern UI Design: Implements a clean, modern interface with smooth animations, including a shimmer effect for loading states.
Dynamic Grid Layout: Uses a staggered grid view to offer a unique user experience with different item sizes.
The project emphasizes scalable architecture, clean code practices, and an intuitive user interface.
